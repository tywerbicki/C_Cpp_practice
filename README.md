# C Programming Language Practice
Practicing various paradigms of the C programming language.

## CSV_Operations

An example of a potential representation of a float data set in C. The program reads in data from `numbers.txt` and stores it in a useful way. It should be noted that this implementation does not contain many necessary checks, and would therefore require some additions prior to deployment in a production setting.

## Statistics
Various computational statistics operations.

### rvGeneration.c
Generation of uniform, exponential, and normal random variables. <br>
Because this program makes use of the `math.h` header file, the `-lm` compiler flag must be included when compiling.
